# PROTECTED SERVER COMPONENTS - DO NOT MODIFY

⚠️ **WARNING: The following files are critical to the Career Pathway feature functionality** ⚠️

## Protected Files
- `openai-service-fixed.ts` - Contains the fixed OpenAI integration that works correctly with ESM imports
- Career Pathway related routes in `routes.ts` 
- Career analysis models in `db/models/careerAnalysis.ts` and `db/models/careerPathway.ts`

## Important Notice

The Career Pathway Analysis backend functionality is complete and operational. Any changes to these files could disrupt this critical feature. The OpenAI integration has been specifically fixed to work in the ESM context and should not be modified.

### Why These Components Are Protected:
1. OpenAI integration is properly configured and tested
2. API endpoints correctly handle Career Pathway requests
3. Database models are optimized for the current data structure
4. Changes could break functionality that users depend on

### If Changes Are Required:
- Refer to the main PROTECTED_FEATURES.md document at the root of the project
- Always test changes in a development environment before deploying
- Document all approved changes in the change log
